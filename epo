  "content" : "A textured fabric for an implantable bioprosthesis is provided. The textured fabric can include a woven base layer and a plurality of loops projecting from the woven base layer. The plurality of loops are formed from a composite core-sheath yarn. The core can be made of a material that is different from the sheath. The core material can be selected to impart strength and resiliency to bending and the sheath material can be selected to impart a larger surface area or texture that facilitates cellular or tissue in-growth.",
