  "content" : "Some aspects of the present disclosure generally relates to materials such as nonwoven materials, e.g., comprising fibers. Some examples of fibers include polyester, rayon, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl acetate, etc. In some embodiments, the material may be functionalized in some manner. For example, a hydrophilic polymer such as polyethylene oxide may be bonded to at least some of the fibers and/or to itself. In some cases, the hydrophilic polymer may be substantially uniformly bonded to the fibers. In some cases, the functionalized material may be relatively permeable, which may allow fluids to flow therethrough. For example, the material may have a relatively high permeability to air, e.g., of at least 5 ft.sup.3/min/ft.sup.2. Other aspects are generally directed to methods of making or using such materials, kits including such materials, etc",
